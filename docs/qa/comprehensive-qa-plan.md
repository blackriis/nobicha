## Employee Management System - QA Phase

**Created:** 2025-01-11  
**Status:** In Progress  
**QA Lead:** PM John & Dev James  

---

## üìã **Executive Summary**

This QA plan covers comprehensive testing of the Employee Management System after completing Epic 1 (Foundation), Epic 2 (Material & Sales), and Epic 3 (Payroll). All major features have been implemented and require systematic quality validation before production deployment.

## üéØ **QA Objectives**

1. **Functional Validation** - Verify all implemented features work as per acceptance criteria
2. **Bug Identification & Fix** - Find and resolve critical issues
3. **Performance Optimization** - Ensure system performs well under load
4. **Security Validation** - Confirm security measures are effective
5. **User Experience** - Validate workflows are intuitive and error-free

## üß™ **Testing Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Functional Testing (Priority: HIGH)**

#### **1.1 Authentication & Authorization Flow**
- **Login/Logout Testing**
  - Valid credentials ‚Üí Success
  - Invalid credentials ‚Üí Proper error messages  
  - Role-based access control (admin vs employee)
  - Session management and timeout
- **Profile Management**  
  - User profile loading (fix for Profile API error)
  - Profile updates and validation
  - Branch assignment verification

#### **1.2 Time Entry & Selfie Capture System**
- **Check-in/Check-out Workflow**
  - Camera permission handling
  - Selfie capture and preview
  - Upload to Supabase Storage
  - Time entry record creation
  - Error handling (camera denied, upload failed)
- **GPS Validation**
  - Location verification against branch coordinates
  - Error messages for out-of-range locations

#### **1.3 Material Usage & Sales Reporting**
- **Material Usage Reporting**
  - Raw material selection and quantity input
  - Validation (positive numbers, required fields)
  - Record creation and linking to time entries
- **Daily Sales Reports**
  - Sales amount input and validation
  - Slip image upload and validation
  - Duplicate prevention (same day/branch)

#### **1.4 Payroll Calculation Engine**
- **Payroll Cycle Management**
  - Create new payroll cycles
  - Calculate base pay (hourly vs daily rates)
  - Handle overlapping periods prevention
- **Bonus & Deduction Management**
  - Add/edit/delete bonuses and deductions
  - Net pay calculation accuracy
  - Validation (positive amounts, reasons required)
- **Payroll Finalization**
  - Final review and confirmation
  - Status changes and data lock
  - Report generation and export

### **Phase 2: Integration Testing (Priority: HIGH)**
- **End-to-End User Workflows**
  - Employee complete day cycle (check-in ‚Üí material usage ‚Üí sales ‚Üí check-out)
  - Admin complete payroll cycle (create ‚Üí calculate ‚Üí adjust ‚Üí finalize)
- **API Integration Testing**
  - Database operations and RLS (Row Level Security)
  - Supabase Storage operations
  - Authentication token handling

### **Phase 3: Performance Testing (Priority: MEDIUM)**
- **Load Testing**
  - Multiple users check-in simultaneously
  - Large file upload performance (selfie images, sales slips)
  - Database query performance under load
- **Mobile Performance**
  - Camera access and image processing
  - Network handling for slow connections

### **Phase 4: Security Audit (Priority: HIGH)**
- **Authentication Security**
  - JWT token validation
  - Session hijacking prevention
  - Password security and handling
- **Data Protection**
  - RLS policy verification
  - File upload security (image validation, size limits)
  - Sensitive data handling (salary information)
- **API Security**
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Rate limiting on critical endpoints
  - CORS and headers validation

## üêõ **Known Issues to Investigate**

### **Critical Issues**
1. ‚úÖ **Profile API Error** - RESOLVED (Enhanced error logging implemented)
2. **Potential RLS Issues** - Need to verify row-level security policies
3. **Image Upload Failures** - Check Supabase Storage policies and bucket access

### **Medium Priority Issues**
1. **TypeScript Errors** - Clean up compilation warnings
2. **Linting Warnings** - Address eslint issues for code quality
3. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Verify UI works properly on mobile devices

### **Performance Concerns**
1. **Image Processing** - Optimize selfie capture and upload
2. **Database Queries** - Review N+1 queries in payroll calculations
3. **Bundle Size** - Analyze and optimize client-side JavaScript
