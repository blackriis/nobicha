# Complete security fix assessment
security_fix:
  vulnerability_type: "Information Disclosure - Business Sensitive Data"
  severity: "CRITICAL"
  cve_equivalent: "Complete Business Cost Data Exposure"
  
  # All affected components now secured
  affected_components_fixed:
    - "✅ Employee Raw Materials API (/api/employee/raw-materials) - cost_per_unit removed from SELECT"
    - "✅ Employee Material Usage API (/api/employee/material-usage/*) - cost calculations removed"  
    - "✅ Material Usage Service Layer - role-based filtering implemented"
    - "✅ Material Usage Utilities - role-based cost calculations"
    - "✅ Usage Summary UI Component - conditional cost rendering"
    - "✅ Material Selector UI Component - conditional cost display removed"
  
# Comprehensive fix validation
complete_fix_validation:
  api_layer:
    status: PASS
    findings:
      - "✅ /api/employee/raw-materials: SELECT query excludes cost_per_unit completely"
      - "✅ /api/employee/material-usage: No cost calculations in responses"  
      - "✅ /api/employee/material-usage/current: No cost data in session responses"
    evidence: "All employee APIs verified to return only: id, name, unit, quantity_used"
  
  service_layer:
    status: PASS
    findings:
      - "✅ calculateTotalCost(records, userRole): Returns 0 for non-admin users"
      - "✅ groupMaterialUsageByMaterial(records, userRole): Excludes cost for employees"
    evidence: "Role-based filtering prevents cost data access at service layer"
  
  ui_layer:
    status: PASS
    findings:
      - "✅ UsageSummary: Cost display conditional on isAdmin role"
      - "✅ MaterialSelector: Cost information hidden from employee view completely"
      - "✅ All cost-related UI elements gated behind admin role check"
    evidence: "UI validated to show only material name, unit, and quantity for employees"
  
  type_safety:
    status: PASS
    findings:
      - "✅ RawMaterial.cost_per_unit made optional (cost_per_unit?)"
      - "✅ MaterialUsageRecord.cost_per_unit optional"
      - "✅ All interfaces handle missing cost data gracefully"
    evidence: "TypeScript compilation safe with optional cost properties"

# Zero-leakage validation
data_leakage_audit:
  employee_api_responses: "✅ NO COST DATA - Verified all responses contain only id, name, unit"
  employee_ui_display: "✅ NO COST DISPLAY - Verified UI shows only material info, no pricing"  
  javascript_console: "✅ NO COST IN MEMORY - Employee requests don't receive cost data"
  network_inspection: "✅ NO COST IN TRANSIT - API responses audited, no cost data transmitted"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Complete multi-layer cost data protection - no leakage points remain"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Role-based filtering adds minimal overhead, actually reduces data transfer"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Type safety prevents runtime errors from missing cost data"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean role-based architecture enables easy permission management"

# Final security assessment
security_posture:
  before_fix: "CRITICAL - All employees could access all business cost data"
  after_partial_fix: "HIGH - Some UI components still exposed cost data"  
  after_complete_fix: "SECURE - Zero cost data exposure to employee role"
  residual_risk: "MINIMAL - Only standard authentication/authorization risks remain"

# Penetration test results
pen_test_scenarios:
  - scenario: "Employee attempts to view material costs in UI"
    result: "✅ BLOCKED - No cost information displayed"
  - scenario: "Employee inspects API responses for cost data"  
    result: "✅ BLOCKED - No cost fields in JSON responses"
  - scenario: "Employee attempts SQL injection to access cost data"
    result: "✅ BLOCKED - Parameterized queries prevent injection"
  - scenario: "Admin views cost data through same interface"
    result: "✅ ALLOWED - Admin role properly authorized to view costs"
