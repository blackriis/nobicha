# Technical debt identified
technical_debt:
  - description: "TypeScript 'any' types throughout codebase"
    impact: "Medium - affects type safety and maintainability"
    effort: "Low - systematic replacement with proper types"
  - description: "Unused imports and variables"
    impact: "Low - code cleanliness and bundle size"
    effort: "Low - automated cleanup possible"
  - description: "Missing E2E tests"
    impact: "Medium - end-to-end workflow validation"
    effort: "Medium - requires Playwright test implementation"
