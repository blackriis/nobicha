# QUALITY GATE DECISION
gate_decision: "CONCERNS"
risk_level: "HIGH"
overall_risk_score: 7.2

decision_rationale: |
  Story 1.1 demonstrates excellent architectural foundation with comprehensive 
  implementation of all required components. However, critical security vulnerabilities 
  and architectural standard violations prevent a PASS decision. The implementation 
  shows strong technical competency but requires immediate security hardening.

# NOTES
notes: |
  This is the foundational story for the Employee Management System. 
  While the architectural approach is excellent and all functional 
  requirements are met, the critical security issues must be resolved 
  immediately. The implementation shows strong understanding of modern
  web development patterns and provides a solid foundation for future
  feature development once security concerns are addressed.
  
  Special attention should be paid to:
  1. Establishing secure configuration management patterns early
  2. Implementing comprehensive security testing
  3. Creating proper development workflow guidelines
  
  The team demonstrates strong technical competency and this review
  should be viewed as establishing high security and quality standards
  rather than criticism of the implementation approach.
