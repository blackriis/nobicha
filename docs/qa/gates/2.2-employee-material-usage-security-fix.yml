# Security fix assessment
security_fix:
  vulnerability_type: "Information Disclosure"
  severity: "HIGH"
  cve_equivalent: "Business Data Exposure"
  affected_components:
    - "Employee Material Usage API (/api/employee/material-usage/*)"
    - "Material Usage Service Layer (material-usage.service.ts)"
    - "Usage Summary UI Component (UsageSummary.tsx)"
  
fix_validation:
  api_layer:
    status: PASS
    finding: "✅ Employee APIs no longer expose cost_per_unit in raw_materials selection"
    evidence: "Verified removal of cost_per_unit from both POST and GET endpoints"
  
  service_layer:
    status: PASS  
    finding: "✅ Role-based filtering implemented in calculateTotalCost() and groupMaterialUsageByMaterial()"
    evidence: "Utility functions now accept userRole parameter and return 0 for non-admin users"
  
  ui_layer:
    status: PASS
    finding: "✅ Conditional rendering based on isAdmin role prevents cost information display"
    evidence: "showCostInfo flag properly gates all cost-related UI elements"
  
  type_safety:
    status: PASS
    finding: "✅ TypeScript interfaces updated to handle optional cost_per_unit"
    evidence: "MaterialUsageRecord interface made cost_per_unit optional, preventing runtime errors"

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Business-sensitive cost data properly protected through multi-layer access controls"
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No performance impact - filtering occurs at data layer with minimal overhead"
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Type safety improvements prevent runtime errors from missing cost data"
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean role-based abstraction makes future permission changes straightforward"

compliance:
  business_requirements: PASS  # "ต้นทุนเป็นความลับที่มีแต่แอดมินเท่านั้นที่ทราบ"
  data_protection: PASS  # Sensitive business data properly protected
  role_based_access: PASS  # Multi-layer RBAC implementation
  principle_of_least_privilege: PASS  # Employees only see necessary data

risk_assessment:
  before_fix: "HIGH - All employees could access business-sensitive cost data"
  after_fix: "LOW - Cost data restricted to admin role only"
  residual_risk: "MINIMAL - Standard authorization risks remain"
