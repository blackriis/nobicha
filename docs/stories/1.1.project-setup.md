## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project - no previous insights available.

### Data Models
Complete database schema as defined in architecture documents [Source: architecture/data-models-database-schema.md]:

**ENUM Types:**
- `user_role` ENUM ('employee', 'admin')
- `payroll_status` ENUM ('active', 'completed')

**Core Tables:**
- `branches` - Store branch information with GPS coordinates
- `users` - Employee and admin user profiles linked to Supabase auth
- `work_shifts` - Work shift definitions per branch
- `time_entries` - Check-in/check-out records with selfie URLs
- `raw_materials` - Master list of raw materials with cost pricing
- `material_usage` - Track material usage per time entry
- `sales_reports` - Daily sales reports per branch/employee
- `payroll_cycles` - Payroll cycle management
- `payroll_details` - Individual payroll calculations and adjustments

All tables use UUID primary keys with `gen_random_uuid()` and include `created_at` timestamps.

### API Specifications
No specific API endpoints for this foundational story. Focus is on project setup and database schema implementation.

### File Locations
Based on unified project structure [Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]:
```
employee-management-system/  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/web/ (Next.js application)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/app/ (App Router structure)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/components/ (Shared components)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/features/ (Feature-based organization)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/ (Reusable UI components)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/ (Shared configuration)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ database/ (Database types and utilities)
```

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- TypeScript ~5.4 as primary language
- Next.js ~15.0 as main framework
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) latest for database
- Tailwind CSS ~3.4 for styling
- Zustand ~4.5 for state management
- Vitest + RTL for testing
- Deployment target: Vercel

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- All database-related types must be imported from packages/database only
- Environment variables must not be accessed directly via process.env in components
- All environment access should go through centralized config files
- API calls in frontend must use Service Layer pattern, no direct fetch from components

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Unit & Integration Testing: Vitest + RTL
- E2E Testing: Playwright ~1.4
- Test files should follow standard patterns
- Basic test infrastructure must be established in this story

### Project Structure Notes
The project follows a Monorepo structure managed with npm workspaces. The main application resides in `apps/web/` with shared packages in `packages/`. This aligns with the serverless architecture targeting Vercel deployment.

## Testing
- Verify Next.js application starts successfully
- Verify Supabase connection and database schema
- Verify TypeScript compilation passes
- Verify basic test suite runs successfully
- Verify all dependencies install correctly

### üö® **Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fix**

**SECURITY CRITICAL:**
1. **Hardcoded JWT Secret** (`database/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql:9`)
   - **Risk Level:** üî¥ CRITICAL
   - **Issue:** `ALTER DATABASE postgres SET "app.jwt_secret" TO 'your-jwt-secret';`
   - **Impact:** Production security vulnerability
   - **Fix Required:** Remove hardcoded secret, use proper environment variable

**ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION:**
2. **Direct process.env Access** (`packages/config/index.ts`)
   - **Risk Level:** üü° HIGH  
   - **Issue:** Violates project coding standards requiring centralized config
   - **Impact:** Conflicts with established patterns, testing difficulties
   - **Fix Required:** Implement proper environment validation and abstraction

**INCOMPLETE SECURITY:**
3. **Missing RLS Policies**
   - **Risk Level:** üü° HIGH
   - **Issue:** Basic policies only, missing for `branches`, `raw_materials`, and other tables
   - **Impact:** Potential unauthorized data access
   - **Fix Required:** Complete comprehensive RLS policy implementation

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium Priority Issues**

**Configuration Management:**
- Missing environment variable validation and runtime checks
- No fallback configurations for development/testing
- Service role key fallback logic could mask configuration errors

**Testing Gaps:**
- No coverage thresholds configured (0% coverage requirement)
- Missing database mocking setup for unit tests
- No integration tests for database schema validation
- E2E tests are placeholder only

**Performance Considerations:**
- Missing indexes for common query patterns (employee_id, report_date ranges)
- No connection pooling configuration for Supabase clients
- No retry logic for failed database connections

### üìã **Requirements Traceability Analysis**

| Acceptance Criteria | Implementation Status | Test Coverage | Issues |
|---------------------|----------------------|---------------|---------|
| AC1: Next.js 15 + TypeScript | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic | None |

### üéØ **Risk Assessment Matrix**

| Risk Area | Probability | Impact | Score | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| Security Vulnerability | HIGH | CRITICAL | 9/10 | üî¥ |
| Architecture Standards | HIGH | HIGH | 7/10 | üü° |
| Data Integrity | MEDIUM | HIGH | 6/10 | üü° |
| Performance | LOW | MEDIUM | 3/10 | üü¢ |
| Maintainability | LOW | MEDIUM | 3/10 | üü¢ |

**Overall Risk Score:** 7.2/10 ‚ö†Ô∏è (HIGH - Requires Immediate Attention)

---

### üìù **Mandatory Fixes Before Next Story**

**Must Fix (Blocking):**
1. Remove hardcoded JWT secret from migration file
2. Fix `packages/config/index.ts` to eliminate direct process.env access  
3. Add proper environment variable validation
4. Implement comprehensive RLS policies for all tables

**Should Fix (Recommended):**
5. Add test coverage configuration and database mocking
6. Implement proper error handling in Supabase client setup
7. Add missing database indexes for performance optimization
8. Create integration tests for database schema validation

---

### ‚úÖ **Story Completion Status**

- **Tasks Completed:** 6/6 ‚úÖ
- **Acceptance Criteria Met:** 7/8 (AC5 partial due to config violations)
- **Build Status:** ‚úÖ Passing
- **Type Check:** ‚úÖ Passing  
- **Test Execution:** ‚úÖ Passing (basic tests)

---

### üìö **QA Recommendations**

**For Development Team:**
1. Establish pre-commit hooks to prevent hardcoded secrets
2. Implement comprehensive database testing strategy
3. Add automated security scanning to CI/CD pipeline
4. Create configuration validation utilities

**For Next Stories:**
1. Prioritize authentication/authorization implementation with proper RLS
2. Add comprehensive error handling patterns
3. Implement proper logging and monitoring setup
4. Consider adding database migration testing

**Final Assessment:** Story 1.1 provides an excellent architectural foundation with comprehensive scope completion. However, critical security issues and coding standard violations require immediate remediation. The implementation demonstrates strong technical competency but needs security hardening before production readiness.
