9. Export functionality includes chart data (CSV/JSON format)

**Quality Requirements:**
10. Charts load within 3 seconds for standard date ranges (month/week)
11. Interactive elements respond within 200ms of user interaction
12. Charts are accessible with keyboard navigation and screen reader support
13. Color schemes maintain consistency with existing design system and ensure contrast ratios

**Definition of Done:**

- [ ] Integration requirements verified (existing data structures work)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks achieved (load times, interaction responsiveness)
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified for all chart components
- [ ] Cross-browser and device testing completed
- [ ] Documentation updated for new chart features
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested

### Story 3: Performance Optimization and Advanced Filtering
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated:** 3-5 days  
**Dependencies:** Story 1, Story 2  

#### User Story
As a **System Administrator**, I want **fast data loading with advanced filtering capabilities by branch, employee, and material categories**, So that **I can quickly access specific insights without waiting for unnecessary data and analyze exactly what I need**.

#### Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1. **Advanced Filtering System** - Add branch multi-select, employee search, and material category filters alongside existing date filtering
2. **Optimized Data Fetching** - Implement intelligent caching and selective API calls based on active filters
3. **Performance Improvements** - Reduce dashboard load time by 50% through query optimization and component memoization
4. **Real-time Updates** - Add WebSocket/polling for critical metrics (current employee count, today's sales)
5. **Smart Loading States** - Implement skeleton screens and progressive loading for better perceived performance

**Integration Requirements:**
6. Existing API routes support new filter parameters without breaking current contracts
7. Current `AdminReportsPage` state management enhanced with filter state
8. Existing date filtering component extended rather than replaced
9. Database schema changes (if any) are additive and maintain backward compatibility

**Quality Requirements:**
10. Dashboard initial load under 1.5 seconds (from 3+ seconds currently)
