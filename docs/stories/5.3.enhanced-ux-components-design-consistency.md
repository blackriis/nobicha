## Status
InProgress

## Story
**As a** UI/UX Developer working on the Employee Management System,
**I want** to implement enhanced UX components (Breadcrumb, Accordion, standardized Tabs, unified Skeleton loading) and achieve complete design consistency,
**so that** users have improved navigation clarity, better content organization, consistent loading states, and a polished professional interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Breadcrumb Navigation Implementation:**
   - Admin pages display clear navigation hierarchy with Breadcrumb component
   - Breadcrumbs show current location and allow navigation to parent levels
   - Mobile breadcrumb behavior adapts appropriately for smaller screens

2. **Accordion Component Integration:**
   - Collapsible content sections use consistent Accordion component
   - FAQ sections, settings panels, and grouped data use Accordion
   - Accordion maintains proper accessibility and keyboard navigation

3. **Standardized Tabs Implementation:**
   - Replace custom tab implementations with Shadcn Tabs component
   - Dashboard sections use consistent tab navigation
   - Tab content maintains proper ARIA attributes and state management

4. **Unified Skeleton Loading States:**
   - Replace custom loading spinners with consistent Skeleton components
   - Loading states match the content they're replacing (tables, cards, forms)
   - Loading experience is smooth and maintains layout stability

5. **Complete Design Consistency:**
   - All components follow consistent visual hierarchy and spacing
   - Color usage is semantic and follows design token system
   - Interactive states (hover, focus, active) are consistent across all components

6. **Enhanced Navigation UX:**
   - Clear visual indication of current page/section in navigation
   - Improved mobile navigation experience with proper touch targets
   - Consistent navigation patterns across admin and employee interfaces

7. **Performance & Accessibility:**
   - Components meet WCAG accessibility standards
   - Loading states don't cause layout shifts
   - All interactions work properly on touch devices

## Dev Notes

### Technical Context
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI
- **Current State**: Basic Shadcn implementation with some inconsistencies
- **Target**: Polished, professional interface with complete design system consistency

### Enhancement Areas Analysis

#### 1. Breadcrumb Navigation
**Current Gap**: No hierarchical navigation indication
**Locations Needed**: 
- Admin employee detail pages (`/admin/employees/[id]`)
- Admin reports sections (`/admin/reports/*`)
- Employee work history and detail views

**Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
// Example breadcrumb structure:
Admin → Employees → John Doe → Edit Profile
Admin → Reports → Materials → Material Detail
```

#### 2. Accordion Components
**Current Opportunities**:
- Settings panels in admin interface
- FAQ sections (if present)
- Grouped employee information display
- Material usage details

**Use Cases:**
- Collapsible filters in admin reports
- Employee detail sections (personal info, work history, etc.)
- Admin configuration panels

#### 3. Tabs Standardization
**Current Custom Implementations to Replace**:
- Dashboard navigation tabs
- Admin interface section switching
- Employee profile sections

**Locations**: Look for custom tab implementations in dashboard components

#### 4. Skeleton Loading States
**Current Issue**: Mixed loading implementations
**Components Needing Skeletons**:
- EmployeeList.tsx - table skeleton
- AdminDashboard charts - chart skeletons  
- Reports data - content-specific skeletons
- Form components - form field skeletons

### Design System Goals

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Consistent heading levels and sizing
- Proper spacing between sections
- Clear content grouping with cards and containers

**Interactive States:**
- Hover effects consistent across buttons, links, cards
- Focus indicators that meet accessibility standards
- Active states that provide clear feedback

**Color Semantics:**
- Primary actions use primary color
- Destructive actions use destructive color
- Success states use success color
- Muted content uses muted colors

### Implementation Strategy

**Phase 1: Navigation & Structure**
1. Implement Breadcrumb navigation
2. Add Accordion for content organization
3. Standardize Tabs implementation

**Phase 2: Loading & Consistency**
1. Unify Skeleton loading states
2. Complete design consistency audit
3. Enhanced navigation UX

**Phase 3: Polish & Testing**

**Design Consistency:**
- Visual regression tests for component styling
- Interactive state testing (hover, focus, active)
- Cross-browser consistency validation
- Mobile/desktop responsive behavior

### Component Configuration

**Shadcn Commands to Run:**
```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest add breadcrumb
npx shadcn-ui@latest add accordion
npx shadcn-ui@latest add tabs
# Skeleton should already be available, verify:
npx shadcn-ui@latest add skeleton
```

**Dependencies to Verify:**
- @radix-ui/react-accordion (for Accordion)
- @radix-ui/react-tabs (for Tabs)
- React Router/Next.js routing integration for Breadcrumb

### Design Token Usage

**Consistent Color Applications:**
```typescript
// Navigation states:
className="text-muted-foreground" // Inactive nav items
className="text-foreground" // Active nav items

// Content hierarchy:
className="bg-card text-card-foreground" // Main content areas
className="bg-muted text-muted-foreground" // Secondary content

// Interactive states:
className="hover:bg-accent hover:text-accent-foreground" // Hover states
```

### Accessibility Requirements

**WCAG Compliance Checklist:**
- Color contrast ratios meet AA standards (4.5:1 minimum)
- All interactive elements have focus indicators
- Keyboard navigation works for all components
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
- Touch targets meet minimum size requirements (44x44px)
- No motion-based interactions without alternatives

**Specific Accessibility Features:**
- Breadcrumb navigation announces current location
- Accordion state changes are announced
- Tab content association is clear to screen readers
- Loading states provide progress information

### Performance Considerations

**Loading Optimization:**
- Skeleton components render immediately
- Component lazy loading where appropriate
- Minimize layout shifts during loading
- Optimize re-renders with proper memoization

**Bundle Size:**
- Tree-shake unused Shadcn components
- Ensure new components don't significantly increase bundle size
- Monitor Core Web Vitals impact

### Coding Standards

**Component Architecture:**
- Follow existing patterns in `src/components/ui/`
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use composition over inheritance

**State Management:**
- Breadcrumb state integration with Next.js routing
- Tab state management with URL synchronization where appropriate
- Accordion state preservation for user experience

**CSS Organization:**
- Use design tokens exclusively
- Maintain responsive-first approach
- Follow BEM-like naming for custom styles
- Keep styles co-located with components
