# Story 3: Performance Optimization and Advanced Filtering

**Epic:** Enhanced Reports Dashboard  
**Story ID:** 1.3  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated:** 3-5 days  
**Status:** Ready for Development  
**Dependencies:** Story 1 (UI/UX Modernization), Story 2 (Data Visualization)

## User Story

As a **System Administrator**, I want **fast data loading with advanced filtering capabilities by branch, employee, and material categories**, So that **I can quickly access specific insights without waiting for unnecessary data and analyze exactly what I need**.

## Story Context

### Existing System Integration
- **Integrates with:** Current `admin-reports.service.ts` API service layer and data fetching patterns
- **Technology:** React Query/SWR optimization, Supabase query optimization, existing filtering components
- **Follows pattern:** Existing service layer architecture and component state management
- **Touch points:**
  - API routes: `/api/admin/reports/{type}` with date filtering
  - `ReportsDateFilter.tsx` component for basic date filtering
  - Supabase database queries and indexes
  - Current Promise.all parallel data fetching approach

### Current System Analysis
Based on analysis of existing performance and filtering:
- **Current Filtering:** Basic date range filtering (today, week, month, custom)
- **Data Fetching:** Promise.all with parallel API calls for all report types
- **Performance Issues:** Loading all data regardless of filters, no caching
- **Service Layer:** `/apps/web/src/lib/services/admin-reports.service.ts` with basic error handling
- **API Routes:** Individual endpoints for each report type with minimal optimization

- `/apps/web/src/components/admin/reports/AdminReportsPage.tsx` - Component optimization
- `/apps/web/src/app/api/admin/reports/{type}/route.ts` - API route enhancements

**New Components:**
- `AdvancedFilterPanel.tsx` - Multi-dimensional filtering interface

- `LoadingStateManager.tsx` - Smart loading states and skeleton screens
- `PerformanceMonitor.tsx` - Performance tracking and optimization

### Advanced Filtering Architecture
```typescript
// Filter state structure
interface FilterState {
  dateRange: DateRangeFilter;
  branches: string[];
  employees: string[];
  materialCategories: string[];
  roles: string[];
  customFilters: Record<string, any>;
}

// Filter component structure
const AdvancedFilterPanel: React.FC<FilterPanelProps> = ({
  filters,
  onFiltersChange,
  availableOptions,
  loading
}) => {
  // Multi-select dropdowns
  // Search functionality
  // Filter persistence
  // URL synchronization
};
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy
```typescript
// React Query implementation for caching
const useReportsData = (filters: FilterState) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['reports', filters],
    queryFn: () => fetchReportsData(filters),
    staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
    cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
    enabled: isValidFilterCombination(filters)
  });
};

// Component memoization
const OptimizedReportSection = React.memo(({ data, filters }) => {
  const processedData = useMemo(() => 
    processReportData(data, filters), [data, filters]
  );
  
  return <ReportDisplay data={processedData} />;
});
```

### Real-time Data Management
```typescript
// WebSocket implementation
const useRealTimeData = (filters: FilterState) => {
  const [socket, setSocket] = useState<WebSocket | null>(null);
  const [realTimeData, setRealTimeData] = useState<RealTimeMetrics>({});
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const ws = new WebSocket(`${WS_URL}/reports-dashboard`);
    
    ws.onmessage = (event) => {
      const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
      setRealTimeData(prev => ({ ...prev, ...data }));
    };
    
    setSocket(ws);
    
    return () => ws.close();
  }, []);
  
  return { realTimeData, isConnected: socket?.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN };
};
```

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Add indexes for common filter queries
CREATE INDEX idx_time_entries_date_branch ON time_entries(check_in_date, branch_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_material_usage_category_date ON material_usage(material_category, usage_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_reports_branch_date ON sales_reports(branch_id, report_date);

-- Optimize query with proper filtering
SELECT 
  e.id,
  e.full_name,
  SUM(te.hours_worked) as total_hours,
  COUNT(te.id) as total_sessions
FROM employees e
JOIN time_entries te ON e.id = te.employee_id
WHERE te.check_in_date BETWEEN $1 AND $2
  AND ($3 IS NULL OR te.branch_id = ANY($3))
  AND ($4 IS NULL OR e.id = ANY($4))
GROUP BY e.id, e.full_name;
```
