- **Touch points:**
  - Report data types: `EmployeeReport`, `BranchReport`, `SalesReport`, `MaterialReport`
  - Existing chart components in `components/admin/charts/` directory
  - Date filtering and data refresh functionality

### Current System Analysis
Based on analysis of existing chart components:
- **Existing Charts:** `/apps/web/src/components/admin/charts/`
  - `EmployeeCheckInChart.tsx` - Basic employee check-in visualization
  - `MaterialUsageChart.tsx` - Material usage tracking

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files to Modify/Create
**Primary:**
- `/apps/web/src/components/admin/charts/` - Enhanced chart components
- `/apps/web/src/components/admin/reports/AdminReportsPage.tsx` - Integration

**New Components:**
- `EnhancedEmployeeAttendanceChart.tsx` - Advanced employee metrics visualization
- `MaterialCostBreakdownChart.tsx` - Interactive material cost charts
- `SalesPerformanceComparisonChart.tsx` - Multi-branch sales visualization
- `ChartContainer.tsx` - Reusable chart wrapper with common functionality

### Chart Library Selection
**Recommended:** Recharts
- React-native with TypeScript support
- Excellent documentation and community support
- Responsive design capabilities
- Customizable styling and animations
- Good performance for moderate datasets

**Alternative:** Chart.js with react-chartjs-2
- More extensive chart type options

### Component Architecture
```typescript
// Enhanced chart component structure
interface ChartProps {
  data: ReportData;
  isLoading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
  onInteraction?: (data: InteractionData) => void;
  exportOptions?: ExportConfig;
}

// Reusable chart container
const ChartContainer: React.FC<ChartContainerProps> = ({
  title,
  children,
  isLoading,
  error,
  exportOptions,
  className
}) => {
  // Common chart functionality
  // Loading states, error handling, export options
};
```

### Data Processing Logic
