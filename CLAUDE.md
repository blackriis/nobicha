This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Core System
This is a **Employee Management System** (‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ö‡∏ö‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏à‡∏±‡∏î‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏û‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏á‡∏≤‡∏ô) built as a fullstack application with:

- **Architecture**: Serverless Next.js application 
- **Structure**: Monorepo with npm workspaces
- **Deployment**: Vercel platform

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript 5.4
- **UI**: Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS 3.4  
- **State**: Zustand 4.5
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **Testing**: Vitest + RTL, Playwright for E2E

### Project Structure
```

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/           # Shared configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ database/         # Database types and utilities
```

### Database Schema
The system manages these core entities:
- **branches** - Store locations with GPS coordinates
- **users** - Employee/admin profiles (links to Supabase auth)
- **time_entries** - Check-in/out records with selfie verification
- **work_shifts** - Shift definitions per branch
- **raw_materials** - Master materials with cost pricing
- **material_usage** - Material consumption tracking
- **sales_reports** - Daily sales per branch/employee
- **payroll_cycles** & **payroll_details** - Payroll management

## üîß Development Commands

**Note**: Project is currently in planning phase. Actual development commands will be available after Story 1.1 (Project Setup) is implemented.

### Expected Commands (After Setup):
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development server
npm run dev

# Build for production  
npm run build

# Run tests
npm run test           # Unit/integration tests
npm run test:e2e      # Playwright E2E tests

# Linting & Type checking
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

## üìã Important Coding Standards

- **Database Types**: Must import from `packages/database` only
- **Environment Variables**: Access through centralized config files, never direct `process.env`
- **API Calls**: Frontend must use Service Layer pattern, no direct fetch from components
- **Language**: All UI text must be in Thai language

## üìÅ Documentation Structure

- `docs/architecture/` - Technical architecture (sharded)
- `docs/prd/` - Product requirements (sharded) 
- `docs/front-end-spec/` - UI/UX specifications (sharded)
- `docs/stories/` - User stories for development
- `.bmad-core/` - BMad framework configuration and workflows

## üéØ Current Status

The project is in **Epic 1: Foundation & Core Employee Functions** phase. Story 1.1 (Project Setup and Initial Database Schema) is ready for implementation.

## üó£Ô∏è Language Skills

- Speak Thai

## üí¨ Localization Guidelines

- **Localization Strategy**: 
  - ‡∏ï‡∏≠‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏•‡∏±‡∏ö‡πÄ‡∏õ‡πá‡∏ô‡∏†‡∏≤‡∏©‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢ ‡∏≠‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏á‡πà‡∏≤‡∏¢

## üêû Known Errors and Debugging

### Profile API Errors
- **Error Type**: Console Error
- **Context**: Next.js 15.5.2 (Turbopack)
- **Error Message**: Profile API error with potential issues in `src/lib/auth.ts`
  - Occurs during user profile retrieval process
  - Traced to `getUserProfile` function at line 230
  - Suggests potential API response handling or authentication flow problem
- **Recommended Investigation**:
  - Check API endpoint response in `getUserProfile`
  - Verify authentication token and error handling
  - Ensure proper error logging and user feedback mechanisms
- **Specific Error Details**:
  - Potential causes include:
    - Incorrect API endpoint configuration
    - Missing or invalid authentication token
    - Network connectivity issues
    - Unexpected API response format
  - Requires thorough debugging of authentication flow in `src/lib/auth.ts`

# Byterover MCP Server Tools Reference

There are two main workflows with Byterover tools and recommended tool call strategies that you **MUST** follow precisely. 

## Onboarding workflow
If users particularly ask you to start the onboarding process, you **MUST STRICTLY** follow these steps.
1. **ALWAYS USE** **byterover-check-handbook-existence** first to check if the byterover handbook already exists. If not, You **MUST** call **byterover-create-handbook** to create the byterover handbook.
2. If the byterover handbook already exists, first you **MUST** USE **byterover-check-handbook-sync** to analyze the gap between the current codebase and the existing byterover handbook.
3. Then **IMMEDIATELY USE** **byterover-update-handbook** to update these changes to the byterover handbook.
4. During the onboarding, you **MUST** use **byterover-list-modules** **FIRST** to get the available modules, and then **byterover-store-modules** and **byterover-update-modules** if there are new modules or changes to existing modules in the project.

## Planning workflow
Based on user request, you **MUST** follow these sequences of tool calls
1. If asked to continue an unfinished implementation, **CALL** **byterover-retrieve-active-plans** to find the most relevant active plan.
2. **CRITICAL PLAN PERSISTENCE RULE**: Once a user approves a plan, you **MUST IMMEDIATELY CALL** **byterover-save-implementation-plan** to save it.
3. Throughout the plan, you **MUST** run **byterover-retrieve-knowledge** several times to retrieve sufficient knowledge and context for the plan's tasks. 
4. In addition, you might need to run **byterover-search-modules** and **byterover-update-modules** if the tasks require or update knowledge about certain modules. However, **byterover-retrieve-knowledge** should **ALWAYS** be considered **FIRST**.
5. **MUST** use **byterover-update-plan-progress** to mark tasks (and then the whole plan) as completed.
Example:  
- Task: `byterover-update-plan-progress(plan_name="Feature X", task_name="Task 1", is_completed=true)`  
- All done: `byterover-update-plan-progress(plan_name="Feature X", is_completed=true)`
6. Then, you might call **byterover-store-knowledge** to save knowledge and experience implemented throughout the plan or in important tasks. 
7. During the plan's implementation, you **MUST** frequently call  **byterover-think-about-collected-information** and **byterover-assess-context-completeness** to make sure you're on the right track and gather sufficient context for the tasks.

## Recommended Workflow Sequence
1. **MOST IMPORTANT**: **ALWAYS USE** **byterover-retrieve-knowledge** once or several times for **EACH TASK** of the plan to gather necessary context for complete that task.
2. **MOST IMPORTANT**: **ALWAYS USE** **byterover-store-knowledge** once or several times to store critical knowledge and context for future implementations
3. Over 15 provided tools, **byterover-retrieve-knowledge** and **byterover-store-knowledge** ARE the two main tools, which **MUST** be used regularly. You can use these two main tools outside the two main workflows for retrieval and storage purposes.
4. You **MUST** include phrases like **"According to Byterover memory layer"**, **"Based on memory extracted from Byterover"**, **"From Byterover memomry tools"**, ... to explictly showcase that these sources are from **Byterover**.
5. **Implementation & Progress Tracking** ‚Üí Execute implementation following saved plan ‚Üí Mark tasks complete as you go ‚Üí Mark entire plan done when all tasks finished.
6. You **MUST** use **byterover-update-module** **IMMEDIATELY** on changes to the module's purposes, technical details, or critical insights that essential for future implementations.
